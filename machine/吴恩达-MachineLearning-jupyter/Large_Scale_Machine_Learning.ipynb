You find that the cost (say, $cost(\\theta,(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})$), averaged over the last 500 examples), plotted as a function of the number of iterations, is slowly increasing over time. Which of the following changes are likely to help?\n",

    "A. Use fewer examples from your training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Try averaging the cost over a smaller number of examples (say 250 examples instead of 500) in the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. This is not possible with stochastic gradient descent, as it is guaranteed to converge to the optimal parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Try halving (decreasing) the learning rate $\\alpha$, and see if that causes the cost to now consistently go down; and if not, keep halving it until it does.\n",

    "A. Stochastic gradient descent is particularly well suited to problems with small training set sizes; in these problems, stochastic gradient descent is often preferred to batch gradient descent.\n",

One of the advantages of stochastic gradient descent is that it can start progress in improving the parameters $\\theta$ after looking at just a single training example; in contrast, batch gradient descent needs to take a pass over the entire training set before it starts to make progress in improving the parameters' values.\n",
