    "\n",
    "图像文字识别应用所作的事是，从一张给定的图片中识别文字。这比从一份扫描文档中识别文字要复杂的多。\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://img.halfrost.com/Blog/ArticleImage/82_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "为了完成这样的工作，需要采取如下步骤：\n",
    "\n",
    "文字侦测（Text detection）——将图片上的文字与其他环境对象分离开来\n",
    "字符切分（Character segmentation）——将文字分割成一个个单一的字符\n",
    "字符分类（Character classification）——确定每一个字符是什么\n",
    "可以用任务流程图来表达这个问题，每一项任务可以由一个单独的小队来负责解决：\n",

    "### 2. Sliding Windows 滑动窗口\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "滑动窗口是一项用来从图像中抽取对象的技术。假使我们需要在一张图片中识别行人，首先要做的是用许多固定尺寸的图片来训练一个能够准确识别行人的模型。然后我们用之前训练识别行人的模型时所采用的图片尺寸在我们要进行行人识别的图片上进行剪裁，然后将剪裁得到的切片交给模型，让模型判断是否为行人，然后在图片上滑动剪裁区域重新进行剪裁，将新剪裁的切片也交给模型进行判断，如此循环直至将图片全部检测完。\n",
    "\n",
    "一旦完成后，我们按比例放大剪裁的区域，再以新的尺寸对图片进行剪裁，将新剪裁的切片按比例缩小至模型所采纳的尺寸，交给模型进行判断，如此循环。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://img.halfrost.com/Blog/ArticleImage/82_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "滑动窗口技术也被用于文字识别，首先训练模型能够区分字符与非字符，然后，运用滑动窗口技术识别字符，一旦完成了字符的识别，我们将识别得出的区域进行一些扩展，然后将重叠的区域进行合并。接着我们以宽高比作为过滤条件，过滤掉高度比宽度更大的区域（认为单词的长度通常比高度要大）。下图中绿色的区域是经过这些步骤后被认为是文字的区域，而红色的区域是被忽略的。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://img.halfrost.com/Blog/ArticleImage/82_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "以上便是文字侦测阶段。 下一步是训练一个模型来完成将文字分割成一个个字符的任务，需要的训练集由单个字符的图片和两个相连字符之间的图片来训练模型。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://img.halfrost.com/Blog/ArticleImage/82_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "模型训练完后，我们仍然是使用滑动窗口技术来进行字符识别。\n",
    "\n",
    "以上便是字符切分阶段。 最后一个阶段是字符分类阶段，利用神经网络、支持向量机或者逻辑回归算法训练一个分类器即可。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Getting Lots of Data and Artificial Data 人工合成数据\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "在字符识别阶段，为了更好的完成分类识别任务，我们就需要给系统提供尽可能多的训练图像，如果我们手头上拥有的图像不多，就需要人工合成更多的数据。例如，我们可以收集不同的字体，并为每种字体的每个字符加上随机背景，这样就可以人工扩展大量的字符图像：\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://img.halfrost.com/Blog/ArticleImage/82_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "另外，也可以通过扭曲字符形状来合成新数据，这也会帮助机器更好地处理发生过形态变化的图像：\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://img.halfrost.com/Blog/ArticleImage/82_7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "但是，为数据加上随机噪声一般不会提升模型训练质量：\n",

    "在机器学习的应用中，我们通常需要通过几个步骤才能进行最终的预测，我们如何能够知道哪一部分最值得我们花时间和精力去改善呢？这个问题可以通过上限分析来回答。\n",
    "\n",
    "回到我们的文字识别应用中，我们的流程图如下：\n",

You will run your sliding windows detector at two scales, 10x10 and 20x20 (i.e., you will run your classifier on lots of 10x10 patches to decide if they contain text or not; and also on lots of 20x20 patches), and you will \"step\" your detector by 2 pixels each time. About how many times will you end up running your classifier on a single 1000x1000 test set image?\n",

You estimate that you would have to pay each of the labellers ￥10 per hour, and that each labeller can label 4 examples per minute.
